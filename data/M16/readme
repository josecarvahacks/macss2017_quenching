Weak Lensing Profiles around Locally Brightest Galaxies (LBGs):
================================================================

planck_lbg.ds.blue.rebinned.out
planck_lbg.ds.blue.out
planck_lbg.ds.red.out

The data files contain a single column with the transverse separation in physical Mpc/h, followed by pairs of columns that have DeltaSigma and its 1-sigma uncertainty (h Msun/(physical pc)^2). The stellar mass bins for those columns are given in the proper order in the header line.

* use 'read_m16_ds' function to read those files.
