Project 1: Learning Galaxy Formation from Large-scale Structure and Weak Lensing


Project Lead: Ying Zu

Github page: https://github.com/nye17/macss2017_quenching

Program per session (2 hours each , total 8 hours):

1. Fitting Halo Mass to Weak Lensing Profiles.

    i. Introduce the weak lensing measurement of Mandelbaum+2016 on the average halo mass of galaxies at fixed
    stellar mass split by colors, <M_h|M_*r>_red vs. <M_h|M_*>_blue. (~20 mins)

    ii. Build a model for NFW profiles at fixed M_h and concentration. (~30 mins)

    iii. Vary parameters in the NFW profile on a grid and overplot the results against the measurements
    from i. (~20 mins)

    iv. Fit individual weak lensing profiles using simple curve fitting. (~20 mins)

    v. Fit individual weak lensing profiles using MCMC sampling, and compare the results to iv. (~20 mins)

2. Predicting Halo Mass from Theory.

    i. Interpret the results from session 1 and describe the steps for predicting them from theory. (~20 mins)

    ii. Measure halo mass function (HMF) and stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) from simulated halos and mock
    galaxies (provided by me) (~30 mins)

    iii. Predict HMF and SHMR from theory (plenty of HMF code online!). (~30 mins)

    iv. Convolve HMF and SMHR to compute <M_h|M_*>. (~30 mins)

3. Constructing Galaxy Quenching Models.

    i. Introduce the halo quenching model of Zu & Mandelbaum (2016). (~20 mins)

    ii. Implement a quenching model into the <M_h|M_*> code from session #2, and predict <M_h|M_*r>_red vs.
    <M_h|M_*>_blue. (~30 mins)

    iii. Measure <M_h|M_*r>_red vs. <M_h|M_*>_blue from the mock catalog. (~20 mins)

    iv. Vary parameters in the quenching model on a grid and overplot the results against the measurements
    from iii. (~30 mins)


4. Model inference.

    i. Write the likelihood functions and run MCMC inferences (~ 30 mins).

    ii. Try different quenching models and repeat the analysis. (~ 30 mins)

    iii. Comment on model selection, quenching of satellite population, extra constraints from correlation
    functions, etc.

Requirements (software, bibliography):

software:
    Python, numpy, scipy, h5py, your favorite HMF and cosmology code (type "halo mass function" into github).

biblio:
    Mandelbaum et al. 2016 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.3200M)
    Zu and Mandelbaum 2015 (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015MNRAS.454.1161Z)

Are there any concepts (cosmology/statistics) that you would like the students review previous to your sessions?
Basic MCMC concepts, basic large scale structure

    None. Just ask questions during the sessions.
